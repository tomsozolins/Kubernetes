# vi storageclass-ec.yaml

apiVersion: ceph.rook.io/v1
kind: CephBlockPool
metadata:
  name: ec-data-pool
  namespace: rook-ceph # namespace:cluster
spec:
  # Make sure you have enough nodes and OSDs running bluestore to support the replica size or erasure code chunks.
  # For the below settings, you need at least 3 OSDs on different nodes (because the `failureDomain` is `host` by default).

    dataChunks: 3

# kubectl create -f storageclass-ec.yaml
